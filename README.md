my configs for GNU plus Linux plus Mozilla computers

Note that `push.sh` overwrites your system's config files, if you aren't a full disk backuper you can `./pull.sh && git stash && ./push.sh` if you aren't sure that you want to be me.

`synced` - list of tracked files
`pull.sh` - updates repository from computer
`push.sh` - updates computer from repository
